# Data Science Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms developed while attending the Foundations of Data Science course at RWTH Aachen University. All algorithms are written in Python.

## Algorithms

- **Machine-Learning:** A machine learning algorithm for predicting outcomes based on data.
- **Perceptron:** An algorithm for training a binary classifier using a single layer neural network.
- **k-Nearest Neighbour:** A non-parametric method for classification or regression based on nearest neighbors.
- **Weighted Majority (deterministic):** An algorithm for making predictions based on a weighted majority of expert opinions.
- **Weighted Majority (randomised):** A randomized version of the Weighted Majority algorithm.
- **Sleeping Experts:** An algorithm for making predictions based on a subset of expert opinions.
- **Flajolet Martin:** An algorithm for estimating the number of distinct elements in a stream.
- **Simple Sample:** An algorithm for randomly sampling a stream of elements.
- **Reservoir Sample:** An algorithm for randomly sampling a stream of elements with uniform probability.
